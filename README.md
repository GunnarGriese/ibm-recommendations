## IBM RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

This project analyzes the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and makes recommendations to them about new articles they will like.

### I. Exploratory Data Analysis

Basic EDA is conducted on the data provided.

### II. Rank Based Recommendations

The first recommender system finds the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions.

### III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

This recommender system looks at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users.

### V. Matrix Factorization

This recommender system utilises matrix decompisition in order to provide better recommendations to the users.
